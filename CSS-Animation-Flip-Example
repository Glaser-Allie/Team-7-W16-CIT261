                    <p>Why is it green?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="back">
                    <p>The most common reason for green stool is a dietary habit 
                        or change. Dark green vegetables contain a lot of chlorophyll, 
                        the chemical that allows plants to make energy from the sun. 
                        This can turn your Cleveland Brown into a Green Bay Packer.
                        It could also be from foods that contain food coloring that doesn’t get processed properly. But sometimes green poop isn't just from your 
                        experimentation with green eggs and hams. Besides diarrhea, 
                        there are underlying medical conditions that can drastically 
                        alter your bowel movements such as bacterial invaders, 
                        antibiotics, etc. However, those conditions will come with 
                        other symptoms besides green poop, so a little tint to your 
                        poo won’t be the first thing you notice is awry.
